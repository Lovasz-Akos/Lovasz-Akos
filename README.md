# I'm Ákos, also known as Naara. Hi! 🦌

My repos are mostly university projects but I have some small projects too, also checkout my orgs.

## Language prefrences 😎

I currently prefer C# over others for both work and personal projects on the backend.

While I'm not too well versed in web stuff, I'm just fine with javascript, though typescript is a nice spin for obvious reasons.

On mobile only flutter comes to mind, miss me with that react native.

Anything else is just dependant on what's needed, I'd rather know the problem before choosing the tool.
